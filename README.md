Control Nodebots with Socket.io

Welcome to Sock Puppet. In this episode you will create a node server, attach an ardunio and start paying tribute to the One True Cage.

Watch a video of Sock Puppet in action below:

To get it running 'npm install', and then 'node server.js'

One thing to keep in mind right now is to make sure that your browser is not trying to connect to localhost:3000 when you start the server.

This uses an arduino, a photoresistor, a servo, and an led
